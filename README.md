## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in a web browser (or use a local server like `python -m http.server`).

## Description

A concise 15-slide website presentation based on Gradient's vision and product story. Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and simple gradient backgrounds.

## Editing Slides

All slide content is stored in `slides.json`. To edit:

1. Open `slides.json` in your code editor
2. Edit the `title` and `subtitle` fields for any slide
3. Save the file
4. Refresh the browser to see changes
